# Library Management System

### Based on Java and SQL Server 2008 A library management system developed with basic add, modify, check, backup and restore functions

#### Precautions
1. The database and backup files are in the Database directory 
2. setting.txt四行分别对应：ip, Port, database login user name, login password
3. To log in, please use the username and password in the Manager table to log in
4. During the development, I think the links that can solve the doubts are all put **解惑的链接.txt** 里了
5. The entrance is **Main.java** document
